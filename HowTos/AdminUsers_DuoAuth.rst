Admin Users and Duo Sign in
=============================================



Objectives
===========

This document describes a reference design using the Aviatrix Controller
console’s user management and Duo authentication capability to
manage multiple users with admin privileges.

As the cloud Ops team continues to expand to manage more cloud
deployments, each team member often needs their own username and password with admin privilege. In addition to a
username and password for login credentials, a 2FA authentication
can be added for enhanced security to manage cloud Controller. DUO
authentication is one of the supported methods. When enabled, it
requires the user to accept a push message on the user’s mobile
device from DUO service in addition to username and password at the
user login time.

The following diagram illustrates the user relationship in a typical
cloud Ops department. In this example, the Ops team has created three
secondary access accounts. An access account is associated with one or more
distinct cloud provider’s API credentials. Typically, a cloud
account corresponds to an IAM account of a distinct AWS and/or Azure
account with a credit card.

A default user “admin” is created by the system. In the picture
below, admin has created three secondary access accounts. 
Additional users in admin
and access account are added by the admin or admin users.

Configuration Workflow for Admin Users
=======================================

Adding a New Admin User
--------------------------------------

The page can be found at Accounts > Account Users > **+New User**.

After the primary access account is created during onboarding, additional admin
users can be added from this page. 


When an admin user is created, changed, or deleted, an
email is sent to the admin’s email address as a record for
bookkeeping purposes. After the user is added, the user can log in to
the console with the specified username and password. The user then
has full access to the console like the admin. When the user logs in to the console, the admin username will be displayed in the top right corner.


Deleting an Admin User
-----------------------------------

The same page can be used to delete an admin user when the
user leaves the group or the user role changes. After the delete
button is clicked, a confirmation email is sent to the admin’s email
address. Note that an admin cannot be deleted by himself or herself
though the user has the full console access. Typically, the admin
user is added or deleted by the special username admin.

Changing an Admin User’s Password
-----------------------------------------------------

The admin user’s password can be changed at the same page. An
email notification is sent to the admin’s email address after the
change is successfully done.

Disabling an Admin Login
--------------------------------------------

**Note**: You need a local user with admin privileges to be created before you can disable the "admin" account.

If you need to disable admin login for security reasons, go to Settings > Controller > Login Customization. Click **Disable** to disable the admin login. 

Configuration Workflow for Duo Authentication
================================================

Getting DUO API Credentials
----------------------------------------

Follow the `instruction in <http://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/duo_auth.html>`_ to setup DUO API credentials on the DUO Security website.

Creating Duo Authentication
----------------------------------------

To enable DUO, go to Settings > Controller > Duo Login.

Enter the Duo integration key, secret key, and API hostname of your
account in DUO website described earlier. Currently, only DUO push is
supported.

Once it is created successfully, the Duo push login applies to all
users (admin is exempt). Every user (listed in Settings > Manage
Accounts > Users) who wishes to log in to the system must have a
matching username in their DUO account.

Removing Duo Authentication
------------------------------------------

The Duo authentication setup can be removed completely by clicking
the Remove button on the same page.

Disabling/Enabling Duo Authentication
----------------------------------------------------

The authentication can be disabled or enabled without deleting the
DUO credential configuration.

API Server Check
-----------------------------------

This button can be used to troubleshoot Duo API server connectivity
when the API failure is occurring.
